Dominick Russo- Self Reflection
Assignment 1


"I spent around 12 hrs working on various parts of this assignment and had trouble with 
variable types and getting the appropriate returns from my methods. I found it easier to 
code things outside of the methods and struggled with getting working functions the way
 the assignment asked. Luckily, my team mates understood this better than I did and were
 able to point out where I was going wrong."
